# Making Blog Writing Easy

I've often thought about sharing my journey when trying out new things. Sometimes, it's just a small hurdle that blocks me for hours—and the solution turns out to be quite simple.  

Sharing these moments could help someone out there. But let’s face it, life gets busy. Writing isn’t just about the text; decisions like where and how to post can feel like separate tasks entirely.  

Well, here’s to giving it a shot. Maybe this post will make things easier for the next time...

## Writing in Markdown: Write. Push. Done.

I already write daily notes in Obsidian to organize my thoughts and reflect on past activities. It's smooth, distraction-free, and avoids unnecessary hurdles.  

When writing feels easy, like it does in Obsidian, the process becomes more enjoyable. If I could use the same setup for blog posts, the initial workload would reduce dramatically. And here we are.

With a Markdown-based workflow, I can create blog posts directly in Obsidian, write without fuss, and publish with minimal effort. Let me show you how.

## Jekyll: Markdown Blogposts Made Simple

Jekyll is a fantastic tool for hosting Markdown-based blogs, but I initially made the mistake of overcomplicating things. Here’s a simplified approach to getting started—no design worries, no unnecessary decisions, just results.

### Step 1: Create a Repository with a Template

To keep things simple, start with a ready-made theme. For example, use this popular template:  
[**GitHub Pages Starter**](https://github.com/new?template_name=mm-github-pages-starter&template_owner=mmistakes)  

- If you want a personal blog, create a repository named `username.github.io`.  
- For other names (e.g., `techblog`), your blog will be hosted at `https://username.github.io/techblog`.  

Later, you can link your own domain if needed. For now, let’s keep it simple.

### Step 2: Personalize `_config.yml`

- Open the `_config.yml` file and update the necessary details.
- Add a profile picture to the `assets` folder.  
- Write an "About" page or delete it from navigation. You can even delete it for now.
- Delete all posts and write your first post.

### Step 3: Commit and Push Changes

Once you've made your changes, commit and push them to the repository. Simple as that.

### Step 4: Enable GitHub Pages

1. Go to your repository’s **Settings**.  
2. Find the **Pages** section.  
3. Select your main branch and set the folder to `root`.  
4. Save and wait a moment for your site to go live.  

If you run into any issues, check the [official GitHub Pages guide](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages/creating-a-github-pages-site#creating-your-site).

### Step 5 (Optional): Use Obsidian for Blog Posts

You can manage your posts directly in Obsidian using one of these methods:  

- **Option 1:** Clone the repository and open it as an Obsidian vault.  
- **Option 2:** Clone the repository to a subfolder in your existing vault. (If your vault uses Git, consider adding this folder to `.gitignore`.)  

Write your posts in Markdown, and when you're ready to publish, push them with Git. I like it to have it next to my other notes. So I can easily use parts of my notes in the blogposts.

## Conclusion

By streamlining the process and focusing on writing, sharing your thoughts becomes less daunting. Whether you're just starting or looking for a simpler workflow, these steps should help you get up and running.  

Start small, keep it simple, and—most importantly—enjoy the process.
