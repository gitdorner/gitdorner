# Making blog writing easy

I often thought about sharing my journey, when trying out new things. Sometimes it is just a small hurdle that blocks me for hours. The solution is often quite simple.
Sharing it would be great, as it might help maybe someone out there. But there are always so many other tasks that wait for me. And it is not just writing the text, decide where and how to post is a task on its own.
Well, let's go on. Maybe next time...

## Writing markdown. Push. Done.

I am already writing notes, using Obsidian on a daily routine. It helps to organize thoughts and can be used to recall what I have done last month.
For me writing there feels smooth and avoids a lot of obstacles. I just create a file, write some text, have some basic structuring elements and don't think about something else.

If I can use a system like this to write a blogpost... Yes. It will definitly reduce the workload on creating a blogpost. It will reduce the task to write the text. And I can write it within my Obsidian app.

## Jekyll. Markdown blogposts

To start just copy a basic Jekyll project template into your github Pages repository (which is named as your username).
And then, just start writing. Think about the design and layout later. It can be done at any time. To be honest, the content matters.
